# C3

## Problem
This is the Custom Cyclical Cipher!

[Original problem](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/407)

### Attachment

[ciphertext](./ciphertext)
[convert.py](./convert.py)

## Solution

At first, the string in the ciphertext file seems like base 64, but a closer look at convert.py shows that it actually is a custom encrypted string. It takes each character in the plaintext, takes its index in the custom alphabet, and converts it to the character in the ciphertext alphabet, with a shift equal to the character of the previous character. Simply enough, this can be reversed. This process is in [C3 (Solution Part 1).py](./C3%20(Solution%20Part%201).py). The output of this is a python 2 script, with a comment at the top stating `#selfinput` so running this script with the input as itself, it returns `adlibs` which we wrap in `picoctf{}` for our final flag.
